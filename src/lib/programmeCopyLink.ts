/**
 * "Do I already have my own version of this ready programme?"
 *
 * Two things in this app make a copy of a catalog programme. Editing a lift in
 * one forks it, and that fork records where it came from — `sourceTemplateId`,
 * see programLineage. Onboarding makes one too: the questionnaire fits the
 * recommended programme to the answers, and what the reader trains is that
 * fitted copy, saved as a programme of their own. That copy recorded nothing,
 * so nothing downstream could tell it apart from a programme typed in by hand
 * (audit round 4, 2026-09-20). The catalog page went on showing the composed
 * week while its buttons worked on the untouched original: the day editor could
 * not find the copy and made a second one, and "Take this programme" adopted the
 * catalog version beside the copy the reader was already training.
 *
 * The link is written now — onboarding's draft carries `sourceTemplateId` like
 * any other copy — and this module is the one place that asks the question, so
 * no screen has to know how copying works.
 *
 * Installs made before the link existed still have a copy with no field on it,
 * and they are the installs the bug was reported from. Those copies are
 * knowable anyway: composing renames every day, and the names it gives carry
 * the programme they were composed from — `onboarding_<programme id>_<n>`, see
 * programDayComposer. That is the fallback, and it reads a day id rather than
 * a programme name, so it does not care what language the copy was made in.
